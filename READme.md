**My name is Anastasia** and what i have learned so far during this bootcamp is how to make new directories, what commands to use and also how to add and remove new files into the directories.
I have learned about new commands to use on terminal for example to make new directories is *mkdir* , to change the directory you are in is *cd* and to add a file into the directory is *touch new-file.txt* ,
I have also learned about Git in terms of what is git and why it is important and how to use it in ~~command~~ terminal. 
Im still abit confused in how to navigate through Github, in terms off how to Git Pull codes from github to my terminal and how to git push my commands back into github.
